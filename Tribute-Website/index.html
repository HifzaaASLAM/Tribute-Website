            the history of South Asia, Jinnah played a pivotal role in the
            creation of Pakistan and remains an inspirational figure for
            millions around the world.Jinnah's political journey began in the
            early 20th century when he joined the Indian National Congress,
            advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity and constitutional reforms within
            the British Raj. However, disillusioned by the Congress'
            indifference to Muslim concerns, he later became a prominent leader
            of the All-India Muslim League.
